- Inheritance in Python

## Introduction

This project was the last assignment of [CS302](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS302%20Flyer.html) at [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu/), designed by [Karla Fant](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/), a great instructor at PSU, for the course CS302, titled [Programming Methodologies and Software 
implementation](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS302%20Flyer.html), in which we practiced OOP with CPP and Python. In this assignment we implemented [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) in Python and practiced OOP in python as well. What was featured in this project is that we also used the pytest 
framework to test our program. Specifically, we performed unit tests on each of the class we implemented.


Here we were asked to keep track of different sorts of "events" (e.g., travel plan, dinner, vacation plan) that we choose. Also, we need to enable the clients to review the events they have planned/participated. 


## Inheritance Relationship and Data Structures


This is a fairly simple program in terms of the inheritance relationship, which is Event->Dinner/Skiing/Travel. Also, a "Review" class was created to provide the review functionality. An instance of the Review class contains a Dinner/Skiing/Travel object. We were asked to create an array of linear linked lists to save the Dinner/Skiing/Travel objects and an AVL tree to save the Review objects.
