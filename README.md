# Python Project Implementing AVL Tree with OOP Applied


## Topics
- Pytest
- AVL Tree
- Inheritance in Python

## Introduction

This project was the last assignment of [CS302](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS302%20Flyer.html) at [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu/), designed by [Karla Fant](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/), a great instructor at PSU, for the course CS302, titled [Programming Methodologies and Software 
implementation](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS302%20Flyer.html), in which we practiced OOP in CPP and Python. In this assignment we implemented [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) in Python and practiced OOP in python as well. What was featured in this project is that we also used the pytest 
framework to test our program. Specifically, we performed unit tests on each of the class we implemented.
